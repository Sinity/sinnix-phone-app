/**
 * The periodic work that is not capture.
 *
 * Driven by the watchdog alarm rather than by alarms of its own. That alarm
 * already fires every ten minutes to check the recorder is alive, so every
 * other periodic question the app has — is an EMA due, has the band written
 * anything, does the widget still say something true — can be answered on the
 * same wakeup for free. Three more alarms would have been three more reasons
 * to wake a sleeping phone to learn that nothing had changed.
 *
 * Ten-minute granularity is coarse, and that is fine for everything here. An
 * EMA prompt is not less useful for arriving at 14:07 rather than 14:00; it is
 * less useful for arriving at 03:00, which is what the waking-hours window is
 * for.
