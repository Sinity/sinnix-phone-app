/**
 * The app's own record: append-only JSONL, one file per UTC day.
 *
 * Everything historical any screen shows is a reduction of this — the
 * continuity ribbon, holes, grant transitions, instrument runs, marks, EMA
 * answers, steering replies. Append-only because a reducer can always re-read
 * a log while a file the app rewrites is a file the app can corrupt; and
 * because the drain takes whole files, so a record that is only ever extended
 * is never half-written when it is collected.
 *
 * Each line carries at least `kind` and `ts`. Unknown kinds are preserved on
 * read rather than dropped: a consumer written before a kind existed should
 * skip it, not lose it.
