/**
 * The one network client.

 * Its entire job is to make the file plane feel immediate when the tailnet
 * happens to be up. It is not the app's authority for anything: every verb it
 * carries also has an outbox path, the payloads are the same JSON objects, and
 * prime treats a live POST and a drained file identically. If this class were
 * deleted the app would keep working at drain cadence.
 *
 * Timeouts are short and deliberate. A phone that has left the house should
 * discover that in a few seconds and fall back, not spin on a socket for thirty
 * while a screen shows nothing.
