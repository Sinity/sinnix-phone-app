/**
 * The phone's inbound half: what prime has, once the app has fetched it.
 *
 * Five kinds of file, all JSON, all written into
 * `/sdcard/sinnix-phone/inbox/` by [InboxFetcher] -- prime used to rsync them
 * here on a timer, and now it holds them until the phone comes and takes
 * them. Nothing below changed with that inversion: the same directory, the
 * same atomic writes, the same FileObserver. What changed is that a phone
 * that is not reachable from prime still gets its receipts.
 *
 * - `steering.json` — the standing menu, open commitments, the ready queue.
 * - `glance.json` — prime's verdict, as data rather than as a page.
 * - `receipts` — one file per thing prime answered that the phone asked for.
 * - `notify` — one file per interruption prime raised.
 * - `decks` — drill decks, which parameterize the instrument engines.
 *
 * Receipts and notifications are consumed: rendered as a notification and then
 * deleted, because a receipt that stays is a receipt that reappears. Steering,
 * glance and decks are state, and are read where they lie. Prime draws the
 * same line -- a confirmed receipt is deleted there, a confirmed deck is not.
