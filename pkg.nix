# Sinnix — the estate's phone-side member, built as a normal Android app.
#
# This used to be a Gradle-free build (aapt2 + javac + d8 by hand) because the
# app had nothing to resolve. That stopped being true when the app grew a UI
# worth the name: Compose, Glance and an HTTP client are not "a plain JAR on
# the javac classpath", and hand-rolling framework views to avoid a dependency
# lock was paying a permanent interface cost to avoid a one-time build cost.
#
# So this is Gradle, made reproducible the way nixpkgs supports: the Gradle
# setup hook drives the build, and `gradle.fetchDeps` records every artifact
# fetch through mitm-cache into the committed deps.json. Regenerate that
# lockfile after any dependency change with:
#
#   $(nix-build /realm/project/sinnix -A packages.x86_64-linux.sinnix-phone-app.mitmCache.updateScript)
#
# The APK is still emitted UNSIGNED, and that is still load-bearing: signing
# happens in sinnix-phone-app-install against a keystore outside the store, so
# `adb install -r` stays an upgrade rather than a forced uninstall — which on
# Android also discards the app's runtime grants.
